#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
#1.Print each fruit in a fruit list:
fruits=["apple","cherry","mango","banana","watermelon"]
for x in fruits:
    print(x)
#2.Loop through the letters in the word "banana":
x="banana"
for y in x:
    print(y)
